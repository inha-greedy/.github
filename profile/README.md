# FHE-RAG: Fully Homomorphic Encryption for Retrieval Augmented Generation

- Welcome to the FHE-RAG project, a research initiative by students from the Department of Information and Communication Engineering at Inha University. 
- Our goal is to explore the integration of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, enabling secure and privacy-preserving language generation.

## Overview

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval and language generation models to produce accurate and informative outputs. 
- However, the document corpus used in RAG may contain sensitive data, raising privacy concerns.
---
- Our project aims to address this issue by applying Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to the RAG pipeline. 
- FHE allows arbitrary computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need for decryption, ensuring end-to-end data confidentiality.

## Key Features

- **Encrypted Document Corpus**: The document corpus used for retrieval is encrypted using a Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme, protecting sensitive information.
- **Secure Retrieval and Encoding**: The retrieval and encoding processes are performed entirely on encrypted data, maintaining data privacy throughout the pipeline.
- **Compatibility with RAG Frameworks**: Our implementation is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing RAG frameworks, minimizing the need for significant architectural changes.
